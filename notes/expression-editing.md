### Expression editing

#### Issues and Ideas:

- [ ] When in the left or right side of a binary expression do not show binary expressions.
  Peope You do not first create all binary expressions and them fill in the operands
- [ ] Do not show binary expressions in `left` or `right` placeholders.
    - People will most probably not use these anyway.
    - allow the shortcuts? And if so, what about options that are larger than one character?
- [ ] If we know something is an identifier (also for references), try not fitting characters in next box.
  - Similar to the number literal in `samples/Example`

#### Binary expressions:

- [ ] switch to show tree

#### Expression edit magic:

- [ ] Add unary expressions
- [ ] Move to core
    - Does parser already use priorities? If not, it should be solved by this.
