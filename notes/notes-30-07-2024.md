- [ ] create the ability to jump to elements by clicking (or something) on its reference

## Things on styling
- everything that has nothing to do with styling in 1 file
- give classes to every component and write css for each of them
- use 'all: unset;' in the css for the component that will (eventually) show a custom box/component
- maybe add the option to include a vertical line left to an indent component
- tinymce editor => have a look at MultiLineComponent2.svelte in M&G's stuff
